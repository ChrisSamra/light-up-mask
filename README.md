# light-up-mask

Inspired by the mask from: https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/06/02/this-arduino-powered-led-matrix-mask-responds-to-your-voice/

I wanted to make a mask similar to this that would light up when the user talked into it.
I used existing Arduino components I already had, including a neopixel ring which I used instead of an led matrix, and made my own code to work with the neopixel ring. Depending on how loud the users voice is, the neopixel ring will light up faster/slower to indicate the intensity of speech. I also taught myself soldering in the process of making this.
